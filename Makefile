#Description: This makefile is designed to compile and link the MatrixGraph project, which includes
#the implementation of a graph using an adjacency matrix and a testing suite for the graph's functionalities.
#It defines rules for compiling C++ source files, linking the object files into an executable, cleaning up
#generated files, and running the compiled application. It utilizes flags for debugging and code analysis to
#ensure robust and error-free code.
